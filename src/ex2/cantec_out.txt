Rain, he wanted it comfortable (Cuvinte: 5, Vocale: 10)
I wanted that pain (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
I WANTED THAT PAIN
He wanted a bride (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
I was making my own name (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 7)
I WAS MAKING MY OWN NAME
Chasing that fame (Cuvinte: 3, Vocale: 5)
He stayed the same (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
All of me changed like midnight (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 9) *
My town was a wasteland (Cuvinte: 5, Vocale: 6)
Full of cages, full of fences (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 8)
Pageant queens and big pretenders (Cuvinte: 5, Vocale: 11)
But for some, it was paradise (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 10)
My boy was a montage (Cuvinte: 5, Vocale: 6)
A slow-motion, love potion (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 10)
Jumping off things in the ocean (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 9)
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice (Cuvinte: 8, Vocale: 13)
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain (Cuvinte: 7, Vocale: 11)
He wanted it comfortable (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 8)
I wanted that pain (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
He wanted a bride (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
I was making my own name (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 7)
Chasing that fame (Cuvinte: 3, Vocale: 5)
He stayed the same (Cuvinte: 4, Vocale: 6)
All of me changed like midnight (Cuvinte: 6, Vocale: 9) *
